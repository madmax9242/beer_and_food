# beer_and_food
Single page app that allows users to log beer and food pairings


This was my first attempt at making a Backbone app.  So, it's pretty basic, but it does achieve the single page quality.  I utilized Bootstrap to put in JS modals and CSS responsiveness.  

Installing it is pretty simple.  You just need to fork/clone it.  Then run bundle install.  

Since this was a mirror app of my regular rails attempt at it, there weren't really any User Stories or wireframes.  The app really served one purpose so there wasn't a need for all the extra stuff.
